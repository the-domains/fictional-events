The mousetraps were untouched.

The rain has stopped.

The power locks on His car aren't working anymore. They worked fine yesterday. The remote still works, but the locks don't. It's one thing after another with this car. He is discouraged thinking about how much this repair will cost, then remembers this is His first car with a remote anyway. Time to go back to the old ways.

Work was busy again. He had a conversation with Coworker01 about how annoying it is that clients break things with no regard and then expect you to fix it, and fix it now. Boss01 again asked for things that He shouldn't need to know/do, but has to know/do anyways.

Friend01 sexted Him again. Turning fantasies into words. It will never be anything more than that, but it's still fun.

There is a such thing as a Christian Agnostic ? That is what Coworker02 claims they are. The title doesn't make much sense to Him. What is agnosticism ? Seems to be the acceptance and perpetuation of ignorance. For those who don't know and don't want to know. So they make sure they never know. Maybe that's wrong.

Chips and dip were for dinner.
