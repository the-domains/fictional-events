He went up to the city to go clubbing with Fiance and friends. It was a good time after He got drunk enough to dance. But since it had been a while, that didn't take too much. The end of the night is when things got weird but His consciousness was a little spotty by that point, so He got the whole story later on:

Friend02 was upset at Friend03 (the boyfriend), and that contributed to her being uncharacteristically friendly with Him throughout the night. So much so that Fiance and Friend04 were commenting about it, so it must have been noticeable. 

As the group was at their cars and saying goodnights, Friend03 and Friend05 went off and left Him with the girls for a moment. Friend02 started lecturing Him to treat Fiance well and take care of her, etc. then suddenly changed subjects and simply laid out, "and you have a small dick."

Silence. 

Silence and confused looks between us.

Fiance and Friend04 then both took it upon themselves to disagree with her, while He just stood there too confused and/or drunk to say anything.

More awkward silence.

Friend04 sheepishly left and Friend02 followed behind. He got into the car with Fiance and went home.
