He brought donuts to work this morning. Not because He is benevolent. Because He has been late to work every day this week due to illness. The NyQuil helps Him to sleep, but doesn't help Him to be on time.

He needs more windshield wiper fluid. What He really needs is a car wash.

It's definitely a Friday. Totally unable to focus on work, He can only think about what He'll do over the weekend.

Subs for dinner with Fiance. Then a long night in front of the computer screens.
